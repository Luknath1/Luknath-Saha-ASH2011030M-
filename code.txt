\title{Universal manuscript template for Optica Publishing Group journals}



\begin{abstract}
\LaTeX{} manuscripts submitted to Optica Publishing Group journals may use these instructions and this universal template format. The template simplifies manuscript preparation and eases transfer between journals. \emph{Applied Optics}, JO``SA A, JOSA B, \emph{Journal of Optical Communications and Networking}, and \emph{Photonics Research} authors should use the length-check template if a precise length estimate is needed. \emph{Optics Letters} authors and authors of short \emph{Optica} articles are encouraged to use the length-check template. Authors using this universal template will still need to adhere to article-length restrictions based on the final, published format.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Adherence to the specifications listed in this template is essential for efficient review and publication of submissions. Proper reference format is especially important (see Section \ref{sec:refs}).

\section{Multiple corresponding authors}

There are two options for indicating multiple corresponding authorship, and they are formatted quite differently. The first format would be as follows and uses an asterisk to denote one of the authors:


This format will generate the following appearance:  

\medskip


\section{Abstract}
The abstract should be limited to approximately 100 words. If the work of another author is cited in the abstract, that citation should be written out without a number, (e.g., journal, volume, first page, and year in square brackets [Opt. Express {\bfseries 22}, 1234 (2014)]), and a separate citation should be included in the body of the text. The first reference cited in the main text must be [1]. Do not include numbers, bullets, or lists inside the abstract.

\section{Assessing final manuscript length}
The Universal Manuscript Template is based on the Express journal layout and will provide an accurate length estimate for \emph{Optics Express}, \emph{Biomedical Optics Express},  \emph{Optical Materials Express}, and our newest title \emph{OSA Continuum}. \emph{Applied Optics}, JOSAA, JOSAB, \emph{Optics Letters}, \emph{Optica}, and \emph{Photonics Research} publish articles in a two-column layout. To estimate the final page count in a two-column layout, multiply the manuscript page count (in increments of 1/4 page) by 60\%. For example, 11.5 pages in the Universal Manuscript Template are roughly equivalent to 7 composed two-column pages. Note that the estimate is only an approximation, as treatment of figure sizing, equation display, and other aspects can vary greatly across manuscripts. Authors of Letters may use the legacy template for a more accurate length estimate.

\section{Figures, tables, and supplementary materials}

\subsection{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\
\subsection{Supplementary materials in Optica Publishing Group journals}
Our journals allow authors to include supplementary materials as integral parts of a manuscript. Such materials are subject to peer-review procedures along with the rest of the paper and should be uploaded and described using our Prism manuscript system. Please refer to the \href{https://opg.optica.org/submit/style/supplementary_materials.cfm}{Author Guidelines for Supplementary Materials in Optica Publishing Group Journals} for more detailed instructions on labeling supplementary materials and your manuscript.

\textbf{Authors may also include Supplemental Documents} (PDF documents with expanded descriptions or methods) with the primary manuscript. At this time, supplemental PDF files are not accepted for partner titles, JOCN and \emph{Photonics Research}. To reference the supplementary document, the statement ``See Supplement 1 for supporting content.'' should appear at the bottom of the manuscript (above the References heading). 

\subsection{Sample Dataset Citation}

1. M. Partridge, "Spectra evolution during coating," figshare (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1004612.

\subsection{Sample Code Citation}

2. C. Rivers, "Epipy: Python tools for epidemiology," figshare (2014) [retrieved 13 May 2015], http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1005064.



\section{Mathematical and scientific notation}

\subsection{Displayed equations} Displayed equations should be centered.
Equation numbers should appear at the right-hand margin, in
parentheses:
\begin{equation}
J(\rho) =
 \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \; \sum_{k({\rm even}) = -\infty}^{\infty}
	\frac{(1 + k \tau)}{ \left[ (1 + k \tau)^2 + (\gamma  \rho)^2  \right]^{3/2} }.
\end{equation}
section{Equations}
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}
	e=mc^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}
	(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}
	log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
\end{equation}
\section{Results}
\subsection{Assessment of parameters}
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{\label{tab:widgets}Detailed physical and numerical parameters of specific locations on MRU campus.}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			&Weight room&Auditorium&Classroom\\\hline
			Floor Area (m\textss{2}) & 770.7 & 194.4 & 					74.3\\\hline
			Supply Air (L/s) & 7830 & 1320 & 426 \\\hline

			Non-peak Student Count & 23 & / & / \\\hline
			Duration Occupied (hrs) & 18 & 6 & 6 \\\hline 
		\end{tabular}
\end{table}



All equations should be numbered in the order in which they appear
and should be referenced  from within the main text as Eq. (1),
Eq. (2), and so on [or as inequality (1), etc., as appropriate].



\section{References}
\label{sec:refs}
Proper formatting of references is extremely important, not only for consistent appearance but also for accurate electronic tagging. Please follow the guidelines provided below on formatting, callouts, and use of Bib\TeX.



\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .tex manuscript file and all figures (which should be in EPS or PDF format) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package. All files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps}, not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there are supplementary materials, the associated files should not be included in your manuscript archive but be uploaded separately through the Prism interface.
